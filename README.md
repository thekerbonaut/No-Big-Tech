# No-Big-Tech
Documenting my process of evicting Big Tech from my life

# YouTube
I am hosting my own instance of Invidious (invidious.io)
This provides me with an open-source, privacy focused, ad free frontend for YouTube.

On Android I use GrayJay (grayjay.app)
GrayJay allows you to follow creators regardless of the platform they publish on. It hooks into all of the popular platforms including Invidious!

# Browser and Search
Currently, I am using Brave for my browser and search engine. Brave is a privacy focused, chromium based browser. Their search engine uses its own indexer (unlike most alternatives which rely completely on Bing or Google) and fills in gaps with anonymized results from Bing and Google. It also provides decent AI generated answers.

I do not recommend DuckDuckGo. I used to be a big fan of their search engine but in 2022 they intentionally allowed Microsofts trackers to function. They have since changed this, but I can't trust a "privacy focused" search engine that intentionally violated user's privacy in the past.

I am also planning to host my own SearXNG instance (https://github.com/searxng/searxng) in the near future. More to come.

# Email, Calendar, Cloud Storage, and VPN
I use Proton (proton.me) for all of these services.

# Photo Backup
I am exploring self hosted and cloud based options right now. Proton Drive does offer a photo backup feature that I may end up using. I am also looking at Ente (I use their 2FA app), Stingle, PhotoSync, and Immich.

# Navigation
For a long time this was a big hangup for me in de-googleing my life. Where I live, life without a navigation app with live traffic data is a nightmare. This was a significant problem for me until I discovered MagicEarth. It is a free app that uses crowd-sourced data to provide all of the features that I need, including live traffic data. I've been testing it for a little while and found it to be good enough to replace Google Maps.

If you trust Apple, iPhone users may be comfortable with using Apple Maps. I certainly trust Apple a lot more than I do Google, but I still consider them to be "Big Tech" and given their own (albiet not as bad) history of privacy violations, I am more comfortable using a smaller, crowd-sourced solution.

# Phone
I am currently using a Pixel 7 Pro with GrapheneOS (grapheneos.org). GrapheneOS is an open-source, privacy and security focused version of Android. It includes absolutely no Google services and, where needed, allows you to use them via a fully sandboxed compatibility layer if you wish to do so.

Again, if you trust Apple and like iOS, using an iPhone is an easier solution, but be aware that Apple is harvesting plenty of their own data from your device.
